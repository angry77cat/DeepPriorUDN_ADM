## Data
Download a synthetic dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11TRY4rgov-kZkgi1D3S2pNx3Sk2ZgGgy?usp=sharing)

## Pretrained Model
Download ADM's Z modules and UDN models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11TRY4rgov-kZkgi1D3S2pNx3Sk2ZgGgy?usp=sharing)

## Running
Please take look at `demo.ipynb` where we provide 8 non-blind deconvolution examples from Set14/Levin dataset, the perturbed noise level can select from 1%, 3%, 5% and 10%.
